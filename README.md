### Online Ordering App
Full-Stack web application built to create a better online ordering expereince for Cafe Madrid's beloved Pick 2 Speical (from their Soup, Salad & Sandwich menus).

### Background
I had the privilege making Cafe Madrid's website on Wix a few years ago. Wix has been great tool to start making websites and they have fulfilled most of Cafe Madrid's needs for their website except for a few specific features. Wix's online ordering system didn't quite support Cafe Madrid's Pick 2 Special so I had to find a round about way to make it work on their platform. As I did my best to implement their specail menu, unfortunately, the user experience was compromised. The goal of this project is to start building a custom online orddering application for Cafe Marid, and the first feature I'd like to foucs on: The Pick 2 Speical.
